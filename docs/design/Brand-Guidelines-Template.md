- Clearspace & min sizes
- Don’ts (stretch, recolor beyond palette, busy backgrounds)

## Color
- Primary palette (with contrast compliance)
- Neutrals (background/surface/text)
- States (success/warn/error/info)
- Light/Dark modes

## Typography
- Headings/Body/Mono families
- Scale and usage examples

## Imagery & Motion

Keep this lightweight; defer detailed component specs to the Design System file.
