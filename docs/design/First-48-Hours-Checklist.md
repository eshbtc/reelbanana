# First 48 Hours – Founder Checklist

Use this to kick off quickly and set the redesign up for success.

## Day 1 (Kickoff)
- Share: Design-Brief, User-Flows-and-Use-Cases, Design-Tokens-Spec.
- Align KPIs and timeline; fill Decision-Log with initial entries.
- Grant access: Figma, Slack, Loom, Docs/Notion, example assets, demo login.
- Confirm Figma file structure and naming; agree on component library approach.
- Schedule weekly reviews (30–45m) and daily async check-ins.

## Day 2 (Validation)
- Review IA + low-fi wires for core flows (async or 30m call).
- Provide actionable feedback using the Review Template in the Playbook.
- Approve one visual route from designer’s exploration by end of Day 2–3.
- Start Copy-Deck for top 10 screens.

## Foundations
- Decide font stack, primary/secondary brand colors (contrast-checked), spacing scale.
- Confirm motion preferences (base duration/easing) and accessibility targets (WCAG 2.2 AA).

Outcome by end of 48h: IA agreed, visual route selected, tokens draft in motion, base timeline locked.
