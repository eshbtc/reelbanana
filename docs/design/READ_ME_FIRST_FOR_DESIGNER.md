# Read Me First (Designer)

Welcome to the ReelBanana redesign. Start with these:

1) Design Brief: `Design-Brief.md`
2) User Flows/IA: `User-Flows-and-Use-Cases.md`
3) Tokens Spec skeleton: `Design-Tokens-Spec.md`
4) Component Inventory (current code): `Component-Inventory.md`
5) Accessibility & Analytics: `Accessibility-Checklist.md`, `Analytics-Events-Plan.md`
6) Handoff: `Handoff-Checklist.md`, `Timeline-and-Milestones.md`

Tech context: React + Vite + Tailwind. Aim to deliver tokenized, componentized Figma with variants and states, plus prototypes for the happy path and key branches.
