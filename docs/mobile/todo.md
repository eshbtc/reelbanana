### üî• __Critical Priorities (Must Address Before Launch)__

__1. React Native Migration & Technical Foundation__

- *Why*: Without a functional React Native app, all other features are unusable.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Adapt existing web components to mobile
  - Implement Liquid Glass design system
  - Optimize AI APIs for mobile endpoints

- *Risk*: Delays here block all downstream work.

__2. Core MVP Features__

- *Why*: Users need a working app to create reels quickly.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Photo selection with face detection
  - Voice input interface with waveform
  - Auto-creation mode with progress tracking

- *Risk*: Without these, user retention will suffer.

### ‚ö° __High Priority (Address Within First 2 Weeks)__

__3. Performance & Device Optimization__

- *Why*: Mobile users have varying hardware capabilities.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Battery-friendly AI operations
  - Device-specific processing (low/mid/high-end)

- *Risk*: Poor performance on older devices could hurt reviews.

__4. Liquid Glass UI Implementation__

- *Why*: Core to the app‚Äôs visual identity and user experience.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Component library (buttons, cards, progress bars)
  - Gesture patterns for mobile

- *Risk*: Inconsistent UI could reduce user engagement.

### üí° __Medium Priority (Address Within 4 Weeks)__

__5. UX/GUI Refinement__

- *Why*: Polish matters for user satisfaction.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Gesture pattern implementation (swipe, pinch, etc.)
  - Error state designs

- *Risk*: Minor UX flaws could frustrate users.

__6. Business Model Setup__

- *Why*: Monetization is key for sustainability.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Native payment integration (Apple/Google Pay)
  - Creator rewards dashboard

- *Risk*: Delayed monetization could impact long-term viability.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è __Low Priority (Address After MVP)__

__7. Analytics & Risk Mitigation__

- *Why*: These support scalability but aren‚Äôt immediate blockers.

- *Key Gaps*:

  - Crash reporting integration
  - AI fallback mechanisms for poor generation

- *Risk*: Lower priority but important for growth.

### ‚úÖ __Recommendations for Prioritization__

1. __Focus on Critical First__: Start with React Native migration and core MVP features.
2. __Parallelize High-Priority Work__: Optimize performance and UI while building MVP.
3. __Iterate with User Feedback__: Test core features early to refine the UX.
4. __Automate Testing__: Reduce device fragmentation risks with automated QA.
