# ReelBanana Mobile App Pricing Strategy
*Sustainable Monetization Framework for AI-Powered Reel Creation*

---

## Executive Summary

ReelBanana's pricing strategy balances user growth with sustainable unit economics. Given the high cost of AI video generation using FAL AI's Veo3 Fast model (~$3.40-4.90 per 30-second reel), we need a carefully designed tiered system with usage limits and smart cost optimizations.

**Key Principles:**
- Limited free tier for viral growth
- Usage-based limits to control costs
- Premium pricing for advanced features
- Cache and template optimization
- Smart routing between AI models
