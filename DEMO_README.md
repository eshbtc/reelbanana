  characterStyle: "A brave young adventurer with a magical staff...",
  scenes: [/* 4 optimized scenes */]
};
```

### Pipeline Execution
```typescript
// 1. Generate story and character
const [story, characterStyle] = await Promise.all([
  generateStory(demoStory.topic),
  generateCharacterAndStyle(demoStory.topic)
]);

// 2. Generate images for each scene
for (let i = 0; i < story.length; i++) {
  const imageUrls = await generateImageSequence(
    story[i].prompt,
    characterStyle,
    { frames: 5, projectId, sceneIndex: i }
  );
}

// 3. Execute video pipeline
const result = await executeVideoPipeline(scenes);
```
